## RAM-only secure messenger for smartphones

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description:

RAM-only secure messengers offer enhanced privacy and security by minimizing data persistence and exposure. A RAM-only system ensures that all user data, including messages and encryption keys, are stored temporarily in volatile memory (RAM) rather than on a hard drive, which significantly reduces the risk of data retrieval after shutdown or compromise.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features:

- ChaCha20-Poly1305 for E2E encryption

- Ed25519 and X25519 for ephemeral key exchange

- Argon2id for key derivation with memory cost of 19456KB, iterations of 2, and parallelization of 1

- DAITA option (Defense against AI-guided Traffic Analysis)

- Client doesn't log anything to storage

- Each message is stored encrypted in server's RAM and wiped after 10 minutes

- Built in Java
